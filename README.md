The concept of this game to solve a Murder Mystery in Comp Sci High
To play:
- You have to investigate all rooms & items that could lead to the murder of one of the students
- Talk to students & teachers to figure out who the killer is
I proud of my idea of this game I feel that this game is different
If I had more time, i would organize my code a little more & make it make more sense. I think my game is all over the place.
